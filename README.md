# pykidgame

small project that I'm writing to help my kids learning programmation
the goal is to offer them a simple way to draw graphics without need of introducing
directly concepts such as event queue, OOP, etc...

the idea is to prefer simplicity over powerfulness or generality, so for example, the screen  have a fixed dimension,
all the images/sounds have to be located into a single place, etc...

while this strongly limitate the possibilities of writing games, the framework is intended to offer
flat and straightforward means to produce functional games
